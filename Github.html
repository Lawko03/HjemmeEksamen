<h1>Git and Github Experience</h1>
<p>
    Git and GitHub have been game-changers for our team, making our workflow more efficient and 
    collaborative. Git and Github really helped improve communication while ensuring that the 
    integrity of our codebase is maintained throughout the development process.
</p>
<p>
    One of the things we love most about Git is its version control. It tracks every single change 
    made to the code, which means we can easily review updates, go back to a previous version if 
    something breaks, or build on top of existing work without worrying about losing progress. 
    This makes debugging much simpler and helps us all stay accountable for our contributions.
</p>
<p>
    Another great thing about Git is how it lets us work independently. Each of us can focus on our 
    own part of the code without disturbing the main project. Once our changes are ready, we can 
    merge them into the main branch. It’s such a relief knowing we can experiment and make progress 
    without accidentally breaking something for the rest of the team.
</p>
<p>
    That said, not everything has been smooth sailing. Some of us had trouble setting up Git connections 
    in Visual Studio Code. Issues like logging into GitHub and not being able to pull the code caused 
    a bit of frustration at first. Thankfully, we pulled together as a team to troubleshoot, share tips,
    and figure out solutions so everyone could get up and running. Now, it feels like second 
    nature—but those early hiccups were definitely a learning experience.
